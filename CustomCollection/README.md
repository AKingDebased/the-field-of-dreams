### Custom Collection

* CC just stands for Custom Collection.

##### CCAbstract

* every implementation of `CCAbstract` maintains a private `length` variable.  this represents
 the maximum length of the collection as instantiated by the user. this is in contrast to, 
 say, the CCList's use of `size()`, which comes from the Java ArrayList docs and represents 
 the number of elements in the CCList.
