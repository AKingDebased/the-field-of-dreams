# Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water.

# After some time, no monkey dared to go up the ladder, regardless of the temptation, for fear of getting soaked.

## Scientists then decided to substitute one of the monkeys. The first thing the new monkey did was to go up the ladder. Immediately the other monkeys beat him up. After several beatings, the new member learned not to climb the ladder, even though it never knew why.

## A second monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The first monkey participated in beating the second monkey. A third monkey was changed and the beating was repeated. The fourth was substituted and the beating was repeated. Finally, the fifth monkey was replaced.

# What was left was a group of five monkeys that, even though none had ever received a cold shower, continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb up the ladder.
