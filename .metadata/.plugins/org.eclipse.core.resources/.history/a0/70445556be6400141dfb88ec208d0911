### Custom Collection

* CC just stands for Custom Collection.

##### on maven and compiling

* you gave us the option to leave maven behind and go back to our old way of doing things.  well, 
i went back to my old way, which is eclipse.  BUT I GOT THE MAVEN PLUG IN BITCHES I CAN DO ANYTHING.
less flippantly, you'll be able to run my program like a maven-built project because it is, in fact,
a maven built project.

##### CCAbstract

* every implementation of `CCAbstract` maintains a private `length` variable.  this represents
 the maximum length of the collection as instantiated by the user. this is in contrast to, 
 say, the CCList's use of `size()`, which comes from the Java ArrayList docs and represents 
 the number of elements in the CCList.
