the distanceBetweenPoints() function was given to the CartesianPlane class.  in my mind, it makes more sense for the individual plane to handle distance calculation.  i didn't want to give every single instantiated TwoDPoint the ability to calculate distance, because a) it didn't make conceptual sense to me and b) seemed like needless repetition of code.

also, although this is not the case with the current program, what if we altered the code to allow for multiple planes?  if we give distanceBetweenPoints() to the TwoDPoints, how do we preven users from calculating distance between points on completely separate plane?  while the current code structure does not perfectly account for that, i find it would be easier to handle point-plane relationships if calculations between points are kept the sole providence of their parent grids.
